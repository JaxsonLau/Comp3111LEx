**Scientific Calculator**
This is a simple scientific calculator program implemented in Java. It provides functionality to calculate the power of a number and the factorial of a number.

**Usage**
To use the scientific calculator, follow these steps:
Open the mainApp1.java file in your Java development environment (e.g., IntelliJ).
Run the main method in the mainApp1 class.
The program will display a welcome message and start executing.
Enter the values of the base (b) and exponent (n) variables as desired.
The program will calculate and display the result of raising b to the power of n using the myLibrary.Power method.
The program will also calculate and display the factorial of n using the myLibrary.factorial method.
The program will end and display a closing message.

**Code Explanation**
The program consists of two classes, mainApp1 and myLibrary.

**mainApp1 Class**
The mainApp1 class contains the main method, which serves as the entry point of the program. It initializes the variables b and n, prints a welcome message, performs calculations using the methods from the myLibrary class, and displays the results.

**myLibrary Class**
The myLibrary class provides two static methods: Power and factorial.

The Power method calculates the power of a number by recursively multiplying the base by itself Exponent times.
The factorial method calculates the factorial of a number by recursively multiplying the number by all positive integers less than itself until reaching 1.
